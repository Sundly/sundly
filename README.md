# Decentralized Personal Health Records

## What do we want to fix?

Universal Health Records!

It's been several attempts of the industry to standardise & centralize universal health records, so everyone and every (HIS/EHR/DPS/GOV/etc) system would be compatible with it.

Unfortunately getting the right incentives for the parties to use such a system is a *very* hard problem, and not very much a technological one IMHO.

In the past many have approached this problem from a centralized point of view. While this approach is not entirely wrong (and not necessarily incompatible with my this proposal), getting the right economic incentives with centralized entities has been proven rather hard.

Today's technologies allow to envision a future where a decentralized network of personal health records is possible, in a private & secure way, where the data is owned by the user himself.
